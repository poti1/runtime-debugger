Runtime::Debugger - Easy to use REPL with existing lexical support and DWIM tab completion.

(emphasis on "existing" since I have not yet found this support in other modules).

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

USAGE

Start the debugger:

    perl -MRuntime::Debugger -e 'repl'

Same, but with some variables to play with:

    perl -MRuntime::Debugger -E 'my $str1 = "Func"; our $str2 = "Func2"; my @arr1 = "arr-1"; our @arr2 = "arr-2"; my %hash1 = qw(hash 1); our %hash2 = qw(hash 2); my $coderef = sub { "code-ref: @_" }; {package My; sub Func{"My-Func"} sub Func2{"My-Func2"}} my $obj = bless {}, "My"; repl; say $@'

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.

    perldoc Runtime::Debugger
